# React Google Maps Example

I was given a challenge to create a web app that provides a query box and a search button and then calls the Places Library for Google Maps. Results should be formatted to give a good user experience.
The app includes:
  1. A map with location markers/pins
  2. A list of locations (Some interactivity is expected between the two)
  
### Installing

Simply run this in your command line tool

```
npm install
```

And run this to start the application

```
npm run start
```
