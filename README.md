# React Google Maps Example

I created this little web app in order to learn react and google map API. It provides a query box and and then calls the Places Library for Google Maps. 
Results are formatted to give a good user experience.

The app includes:
  1. A map with location markers/pins
  2. A list of locations, the first location gets centered by default
  3. If the user clicks on any of the location, the map will be centered by the new location.
  
### Installing

Simply run this in your command line tool

```
npm install
```

And run this to start the application

```
npm run start
```

## Features
1. query box that can search for any locations as you type in
![Alt text](/screenshots/home.png?raw=true "Home Page")
2. responsive map, refined UI to give good user experience with locations
![Alt text](/screenshots/locations.png?raw=true "searching locations")
3. interactivity between location you searched and the map
4. one page app with routes
